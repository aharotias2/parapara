ParaPara
================================================================================

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_ParaPara_ is an image viewer created with lightweight and high-speed operation in mind.

It is supposed to be linked to the extension and opened by double-clicking from your
favorite file manager.

By displaying the two images on the left and right,
you can also see manga in a two-page spread.
You can switch between right-to-left and left-to-right page turning.
